# Pit_stop_3_DLS_assigment

In this data set I focused on digital lietarture - interactive fiction.
For creation of this data set I have chosen these criteria: Title, Creator, Year of Creation, URL, type, technology, interaction level, versioning, language, metadata source, license.
I have choese these categories because I wanted to have basic information about the items (title, creator, year od creation, type), then I wanted to see how it work and what was used for creating of the items (technology, interaction level). The criteria of versioning was chosen becouse I wanted to see if the story is finished, if it is work in progress or if it was changed from the original story. Criteria of language was chosen because I wnted to see in whicg languages it is possible to read digital literature. Criteria of metadata source was chosen to see where we can find information about the items - mostly it was the platform as Electronic Literature Collection, The Interactive Fiction Database.

Limitations:
All of the items are in English. I wanted to focus on langusges that I can speak and understand at least on basic level (Slovak, Czech, English, Polish) and I did not succeed. I also wanted to use items that have meta data available. These were found mostly in The Interactive Fiction Database platform.
