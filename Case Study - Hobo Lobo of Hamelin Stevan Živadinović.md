**Object overview**

Hobo Lobo of Hamelin is currently unfinished graphical story by Stevan Živadinović about Hobo Lobo who is a professional renaissance journeyman. One day he arrives in a town called Hamelin, in which they have a problem with rats. The mayor of the town wants to solve this problem because the elections are coming. When Hobo Lobo arrives at Hamelin the mayor asks him for help and tells him that he will pay him after. When Hobo Lobo gets rid of the rats the mayor's office takes full responsibility for it and everyone celebrates the mayor for this win.  But when Hobo Lobo wants to pick up the invoice and his payment everyone at the mayor's office acts like they know nothing about it and the mayor throws him out. Hobo Lobo tries to sue the mayor but that does not work out and now he must pay for the trial. 

The whole story does not have a lot of text and is supplemented with illustrations of what is currently happening. It's available on [hobolobo.net](http://hobolobo.net) in English, French and Spanish language. It is red by side-scrolling to the right (or left when we want to reread something). This movement rolls the text part of the story as well as the illustrations. 

**Textual model and medium**  
It is a linear story without interaction of the user. When reading we can go back but it does not change the story we can just reread it. The story can be reed on the web browser. It was made in Photoshop CS3 & CS5. Images were optimised with [ImageAlpha](http://pngmini.com/) and [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/). [Range Serif](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/range-serif/) is the typeface ([http://hobolobo.net/what-is-this-thing](http://hobolobo.net/what-is-this-thing) ).

**Narratology**  
The story is told by a heterogenic narrator and focalization is external \- camera-eye. It is mostly told by  the narrator but there are some dialogues. 

**Quantitative glimpse**

Quantitative analysis did not work on this story. It was influenced by words as the beginning, page 1… that were not part of the story but the interface and it was only possible with one page of the story \- when I tried to add more pages to the corpus it failed.

**FInal**  
This object makes it possible to enjoy the story of Hobo Lobo with illustrations and music at our own pace. It is not interactive so the reader can't choose the path of the story but the reading is based on side-scrolling so readers can read and enjoy illustration how long they want. The limit is internet connection that needs to be strong and stable because without it it is hard to read. If the story was available only in print we would lose the overlapping illustrations and music that complements the story.
